# Fifth Website: Third-Party APIs - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to refactor a Work Day Scheduler website to give it proper functionality.
- I worked on this project as a means to understand how to work with third-party APIs when developing webpages.
- The problem this project solves is that the day scheduler had no functionality or visible gui at all. It was merely the shell of a work day scheduler.
- I have learned that third-party APIs can drastically improve the visuals and functionality of a website in ways that vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML cannot.
